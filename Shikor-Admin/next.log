We detected TypeScript in your project and reconfigured your tsconfig.json file for you.

The following suggested values were added to your tsconfig.json. These values can be changed to fit your project's needs:

        - lib was set to dom,dom.iterable,esnext
        - skipLibCheck was set to true
        - strict was set to false
        - forceConsistentCasingInFileNames was set to true
        - noEmit was set to true
        - include was set to ['next-env.d.ts', '**/*.ts', '**/*.tsx']

The following mandatory changes were made to your tsconfig.json:

        - esModuleInterop was set to true (requirement for babel)
        - resolveJsonModule was set to true (to match webpack resolution)
        - isolatedModules was set to true (requirement for babel)
        - jsx was set to preserve (next.js implements its own optimized jsx transform)
