# Getting started with `Typescript`

## Installation 
On locally (recommened) `npm install typescript --save-dev`

Run a single typescript file > `npx tsc --filename.ts`

Add a typescript configuration file to run smoothly using `npx tsc --init` command

Add a watch mode so that we can't run with the terminal over and over. Simple type `tsc -w` to add a watch mode.

## Custom setup 

We made some changes into tsconfig.json. `es5` to `es6` & `outDir":"./"` to `outDir": "./js"`
